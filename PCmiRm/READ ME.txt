PCmiRm guidelines.

The whole tool run as a whole from first until third phase, but each output from each phase has a pah and can be used by the user for desired analysis.

The first phase:
The first phase of the tool is a C++ code that present the output as all possible coregulation modules (or bicliques) give a list of miRNAs, target genes and their interactions as input. This part also asks for two parameters that represents the maximum number of miRNAs in the modules and the minimum number of genes in the modules.
The inputs for this phase are: 1- the name of the miRNA list file
			       2- the name of the target genes list file
			       3- the name of the interactions/network file
			       4- A number representing the max number of miRNAs (the default is 29, if no number is added)
			       5- A number representing the minimun number of genes in the modules
			
The output from this phase is written inside PCmiRm/data/inputs entitled "File6_allmodules.csv" has all possible bicliques given the inputed network and can be used further.

The second phase:
